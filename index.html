            <div class = "text1">In second year mechanical engineering my team was tasked with
                designing an assembly that would launch a vehicle across a large playing surface.
                The vehicle then shoots a ball towards a gravity well. This project was meant to 
                simulate a moon lander launch to send a probe onto a planet. I thought the scenario
                was a bit of a stretch but that is more a question of the curriculum.
