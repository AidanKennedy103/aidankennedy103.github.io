        <div class="text1">When working on a team of engineers you are sorrounded by bright technical minds that can develop fantastic projects.
            Unfortunately we have a tendency to have trouble "zooming out" on the larger picture of how our work fits into the larger team goals.
            This page describes some of the project management tools I have helped to implement on UBC Formula Electric to help steer the team in 
            the right direction. Management tools are an interesting problem on a student team, the personel turnover is so high amongst members but 
            also among your managers. I have found the best way to set the team up for success is put tools in place that help steer the team with a 
            low time investment for the managers.

        <div class="text1">I have always been a CAD focused engineer. CAD is the best tool we have to communicate our ideas to other engineers and 
            manufacturers, yet the implementation of CAD in student teams and even in industry is awkward and under-utilized. This is why I have been 
            driving a team switch to "Parametric Modelling" with a "Top-Down" approach. I inherited an interest in proper CAD use from someone who mentored 
            me during my early days on the team. This method of using CAD effictively allows members to work on their parts individually with their changes propogating to 
            the higher level topends without them having to do anything. It is also focused on stability,

        <div class="text1">I sourced a radiator which seemed to fit our system. Unfortunately the radiators
            we have to choose from had very poor data. Therefore, I decided to do in-house testing on our radiator
            at our universities wind tunnel. I did this with a small group for a class project, and found the minimum 
            windspeed required to keep the components cooled. Which allowed me to design a shroud around the radiator 
            and size fans to pull air through the system.

    <div class="grid-item">
        <div class="text1">Once we had chosen all the components in our system we were able to source a pump that would 
            match all of the criteria that we had set out. This turned out to be very difficult because our LV rail runs at 24V 
            which is not the norm for small BLDC pumps. The best pump I was able to source was an underwater pump which meant it
            needed to be submerged in a reservoir. The rules of our competition demand that we have a "catch can" to account for thermal 
            expansion in our system. This actually played into our favour as I was able to argue that our reservoir also acted as 
            a catch can which meant we no longer had to seperately design a catch can.

    <div class="grid-item">
        <div class="text1">The total Pressure drop before motors = 11.6PSI. We will run with the motors at approximately 25 PSI to ensure we do not 
            damage them through over pressure. Therefore the pump must generate approx 36.6 PSI which translates to 84.44532777367279 ft of head. 
            Comparing this to the pump I chose we should get approximately 15 LPM of flow which will be more than enough for our system. 
            Even with more minor losses in our fittings and hoses. The pump we chose is also driven off a physical potentiometer meaning we can tun 
            the system to find the "sweet spot" and get the exact flow rate we want.

        <div class="text1">To validate our simulation we had to test our system. This is temperature data from autcross lap tests. 
            We planned to do endurance testing but were unable to gather the necessary data and decided to validate through an 
            autocross lap on a cold track day. We compared the thermal generation to the temperature changes to find the thermal 
            mass of all of the components in our system.

        <div class="text1">This allowed us to actually graph the temperatures of our components and make sure that at no point
            a component spiked above it's maximum temperature to ensure we could succesfully complete our endurance event!
